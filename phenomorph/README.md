## Usage
**ml-morph** performs automated landmarking in images of semi-rigid biological structures. To generate landmark predictions, we need to train machine learning models using manually annotated datasets. These manually annotated datasets can be generated and administered using the [phenopype](https://www.phenopype.org/) package, so this module should be seen as a contrib package that adds ml-morph functionality to the main package.
